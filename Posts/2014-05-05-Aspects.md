[Peter] open-sourced [Aspects] yesterday, a library for aspect oriented
programming.

This can be pretty useful, for instance when you're implementing custom logging
or need to hook into the view controller life-cycle methods if subclassing is
not an option.

It's inspired by, and be used as an alternative to `-rac_signalForSelector:` in
ReactiveCocoa. Also check out [this article][codeshaker] that explains what's
going on under the hood.
