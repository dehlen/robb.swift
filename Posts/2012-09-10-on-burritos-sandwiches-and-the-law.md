> Is a burrito a sandwich? We know what the judges say.

My buddy Parker completely in his element, talking about the intersection of law
and mexican cuisine:

> Posner and Scalia have differing opinions on the 2006 landmark burrito law
> case White City Shopping Center, LP v. PR Restaurants, LLC … in which a
> Massachusetts judge held that a burrito is not a sandwich.

A must read. (Man, I do miss Cancun right now)
