When Chris, Florian and Daniel started [objc.io](http://objc.io), I immediately
knew I wanted to contribute an article, but it took me 12 months of lurking on
the mailing list to find something to write about.

[This issue][12] is all about animations, and full of great articles by guest
authors [Engin Kurutepe][engin], [Joachim Bondo][joachim], [David
Rönnqvist][david], [Nick Lockwood][nick] and yours truly.

[My article][animations-explained] serves as an introduction to Core Animation
and the different types of animations you can employ to breath live into your
app. I had a lot of fun writing it and building the .gifs. [Let me know what you
think of it on Twitter!][twitter].
