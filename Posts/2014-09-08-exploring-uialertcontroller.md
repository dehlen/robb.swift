[Ash] explains the new `UIAlertController` that replaces `UIAlertView` in
iOS 8 and gives you some examples how to use the new APIs in Swift. He writes:

> The new UIAlertController has some great benefits:
>
> - It’s explicit
> - It conforms to iOS composability conventions
> - It’s got a clear API
> - It’s reusable in different contexts (iWatch vs iWatch mini)
>
> The drawbacks are:
>
> - It’s unfamiliar

In other words: [`UIAlertView` is easy, `UIAlertController` is simple](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy).
