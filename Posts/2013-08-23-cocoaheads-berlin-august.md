I finally attended [CocoaHeads Berlin][ch-berlin] for the first time last
Wednesday. I gave a talk on [Underscore.m] and [Asterism], the slides are
embedded here:

<div class="embed rich speaker deck">
    <style type="text/css" scoped>
        .embed:after {
            padding-top: 65.2112676056338% !important;
        }
    </style>
