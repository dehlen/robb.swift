I've been working on Asterism for quite a while now, but I only recently got
around to put up [proper documentation][docs].

Asterism is a functional toolbelt that uses [overloaded C
functions][overloadable] to unify its API. This allows you to use the same
method for different data structures and block types:

```objectivec
ASTEach(@[ @"a", @"b", @"c" ], ^(NSString *letter) {
    NSLog(@"%@", letter);
});

ASTEach(@[ @"a", @"b", @"c" ], ^(NSString *letter, NSUInteger index) {
    NSLog(@"%u: %@", index, letter);
});

ASTEach(@{ @"foo": @"bar" }, ^(NSString *key, NSString *value) {
    NSLog(@"%@: %@", key, value);
});
```

It supports all the usual methods for `NSArray`, `NSDictionary`, `NSSet` and
`NSOrderedSet`.

You can check out Asterism [on GitHub][github] and of course, [install it
through CocoaPods][cocoapods].
