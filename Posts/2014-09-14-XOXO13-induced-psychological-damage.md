[Andy Matuschak](https://twitter.com/andymatuschak), now at Khan Academy and previously working on UIKit:

> I had a safe job. People enthused all the time about how lucky I was, what
> great work I was doing. No doubt: I held a wonderful position! So I felt like
> an asshole for suggesting anything else.
>
> I’d bring up my real aspirations only occasionally, and whenever I did, I’d
> feel dissatisfaction grow within me. But then the conversation would end, and
> I’d anesthetize that dissatisfaction into “someday” with the grind of urgent
> tasks. Those tasks were much easier to think about than my thwarted ambitions,
> so my discontent conveniently settled beneath the hum of the day-to-day.
